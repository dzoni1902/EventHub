This is a small MVC application, made for training and learning purpose.
It enables users (artists) to create profile, create their own events, follow other artists, add their events to the calendar...
App has implemented notifications (similar to FB, but simple :) which inform the user when an event he added to the calendar is canceled 
or some of it's parameters (time, date, venue...) changed.
Tech stack used: .NET framework and C#, SQL Server, Entity Framework (code first approach), Identity (for users and roles) etc. for BackEnd and 
                  jQuery, Vanilla JS, moment.js, underscore.js, Bootstrap... for FrontEnd
             
Implemented Clean architecture, added UnitTests, still some work to be done.

Cheers ;)
